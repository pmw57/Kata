FooBarQix rules:

- If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
- If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
- For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.
- Keep track of every 0 in the numbers, replacing them with an asterisk “*“ character.
